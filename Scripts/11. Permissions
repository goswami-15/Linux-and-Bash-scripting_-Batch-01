Linux permissions dictate 3 things you may do with a file, read, write and execute. They are referred to in Linux by a single letter each.

r read - you may view the contents of the file.
w write - you may change the contents of the file.
x execute - you may execute or run the file if it is a program or script.
For every file we define 3 sets of people for whom we may specify permissions.

owner - a single person who owns the file. (typically the person who created the file but ownership may be granted to some one else by certain users)
group - every file belongs to a single group.
others - everyone else who is not in the group or the owner.
